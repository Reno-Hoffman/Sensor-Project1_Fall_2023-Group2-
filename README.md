# Sensor-Project1_Fall_2023-Group2-

In this project, we have looked at three different sensors to test a variety of static characteristics to see how well our provided sensor performs compared to their manufacturer specifications. Reno Hoffman was in charge of the DHT-11, Daniel Kloppe had the MPU 6050; Haizi Cao and Haoxaun Li had the Ultrasonic Ranging Module.
I have created folders for each individual sensor, within those folders are additional folders relating to the milestones one needs to complete along with each step of testing and analysis. Each milestone folder is based around the specific testing my partners and I conducted with our specific circumstances and are therefore more general guidelines than one-to-one recreation. Milestone folders will also contain all the information and code needed to conduct similar tests. 


Milestone #1: This folder will contain the background of the sensor, the initial testing proposal, what static characteristics to look for, and what code is needed, along with hardware wiring photos and manufacturing datasheets.

Milestone #2:  This will be an example of a simulated test and the raw collected results from each test.

Milestone #3: This will contain an example of analyzing data collected to find static characteristics. It will also have a summary of our test results, our additional comments, and possible improvement ideas.

Allow with the milestone folders are some individual files for an overview of formating information into different word documents and a presentation.
