# Sensor-Project1_Fall_2023-Group2-

In this project, we have looked at three different sensors to test a variety of static characteristics to see how well our provided sensor performs compared to their manufacturer specifications and presented our findings to our class. 
Reno Hoffman was in charge of the DHT-11, Daniel Kloppe had the MPU 6050; Haizi Cao and Haoxaun Li had the Ultrasonic Ranging Module.

The Arduino code used can be found in the Sensor Proposal along with the wiring diagrams/setups and testing method.
