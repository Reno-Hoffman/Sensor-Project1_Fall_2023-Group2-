MPU-6050 

The MPU-6050 tracks motion. It uses a 3-axis accelerometer which uses piezo-electric effects to track the acceleration acting on it in unit vectors. 
This includes acceleration from motion and gravity. 
It also uses a 3-axis Gyroscope to measure the change in angle over time around the unit axes.  
To measure the static characteristics of the MPU-6050, acceleration and orientation must be considered. For static state acceleration, the drift and static error can be measured. 
The drift can be measured by placing the sensor in a stationary position and observing deviations in the acceleration over time. 
The static error can be measured by observing the error between the acceleration of the sensor while stationary and its output. 
This can be repeated with the sensor in varying orientations. The values will be compared to a level and the angles will be oriented with the aid of a protractor. 
To obtain expected values, trigonometry, and physics will be used in calculations. To check the static characteristics of the gyroscope in the sensor, 
the same characteristics can be measured. The drift will be found by leaving the sensor in a stationary position and observing the variation from zero over time.
The static error can then be measured by once again leaving the sensor in a stationary position and finding the absolute error from the observed values. 
Other applicable characteristics will be measured in a similar manner.
