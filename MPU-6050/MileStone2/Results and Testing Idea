First, a level was used to ensure the work surface was smooth and flat. 
Once this was confirmed, a reading was collected for the level accelerometer. 
Then, the accelerometer was adjusted to a steeper angle using 5 degree increments
around the x-axis with the help of items such as paper and cup holders.
A digital angle finder was used to attain 5 degree increments. 
After each initial measurement, the sensor was left in place for a
2 minute period before collecting another reading. Once 15 degrees was reached, 
the process was repeated around the y-axis. 
The relative error between the initial and final readings were averaged
to find a value for drift.  

Next, the sensor was placed in a level position and a reading was collected. 
It was then rotated around the y-axis until a change was registered 
in the acceleration reading in the x-direction.
A digital angle finder was used to collect a reading for the sensorâ€™s 
angle off of level. This process was then repeated until at 
least 6 sets of values were recorded. 
The process was then repeated observing the y-direction 
while rotating around the x-axis.
