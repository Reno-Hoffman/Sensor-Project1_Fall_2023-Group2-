With the consideration of component vectors, the following equation was used to find the acceleration acting on the x and y faces for their respective data. 

a = 1*(gravity acceleration) *sin(angle)
In this equation, 1 g is equal to the gravitational acceleration constant. 
The calculated value of acceleration was plotted on the x-axis of a graph against the least significant bit. 
The least significant bit was found with the following equation.  

LSB = (output)*(# of bits) / (output range)


The resulting graphs were then fitted with lines of best fit to observe linearity. The slope of this line is equal to the sensitivity of the sensor.
