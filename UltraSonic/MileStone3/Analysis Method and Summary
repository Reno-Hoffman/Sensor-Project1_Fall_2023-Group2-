The basic idea for analysis is inputting information into Excel for graphing and determining static characteristics.

After testing, the detection range of this type of sensor is 2.1cm to 186.5cm, which is less than 2cm to 400cm. 
In addition, the static error of this type of sensor is 0.445cm, with a precision of 0.63mm, which is much smaller than the 3mm in the manufacturer's datasheet. 
In the end, we believe that the testing performance of this sensor is poor. 

Discussion: 

In this experiment, we gained a certain understanding of the working principle and performance of ultrasonic sensors. 
We hope to minimize the impact of environmental noise on this experiment in future experiments.
