Ultrasonic Ranging Module 
The theory of an ultrasonic sensor is to emit a sound wave of a certain frequency at one end of the sensor. 
When this sound wave contacts the surface of an object, it will rebound back to the receiver, 
thereby obtaining the distance between the sensor and the measured object. 
Ultrasonic ranging module provides 2cm (about 0.79 in) - 400cm (about 13.12 ft) non-contact measurement function, and the ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm (about 0.12 in). 
It can ensure that the signal is stable within 5m, and the signal is gradually weakened after 5m, till the 7m position disappears.  

For this part we will find the range, static error, and precision of ultrasonic ranging module. 
To measure the range, firstly we plan to put an object in front of the ultrasound sensor. 
We will increase the distance between it and the object gradually (Stop measuring until normal data cannot be displayed). 
Then we will observe the changes in the measured data and record it down. 
To get static error, we will first record the data measured between the maximum range and the minimum range and then calculate the error. 
To get the Precision, we can calculate it by the standard deviation with a set of readings of the sensor for the same input.
