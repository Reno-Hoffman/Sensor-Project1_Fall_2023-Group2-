The DHT11 is a simple, inexpensive digital temperature and humidity sensor.
It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin. 
From the findings and basic overview, calibration of the specific DHT11 was minimal. 


Test proposal -  
To measure almost all the static characteristics of the DHT11 a variety of different environments will be simulated and placing the sensor next to different objects that 
will affect the temperature and humidity of the readings from the sensor. 
These readings will be compared to both the datasheet and an additional temperature and humidity measuring device that will serve as a control when compared to the sensor. 
The DHT will be placed in colder environments that will be compiled to find the sensitivity through graphing the measured against the control.
Resolution will be similarly tested however it will be looking for the smallest change detectable be the sensor. 
All other static characteristics will be tested similarly with comparison to the data spreadsheet, the control measuring device, and the different simulated environments. 
Control will use Acurite indoor temperature and humidity thermometer.
