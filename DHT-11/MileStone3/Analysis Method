For determining all static characteristics of temperature plug in measured values into Excel and find the linear fit that describes your data. this fits slope will
describe your sensitivity. Your Resolution is determined by your display code/Arduino setup, as well as the smallest change in the graph information.

For Humidity, you could either use Excel or MatLab for plotting dynamic information and using inbuilt systems to find linear fit and resolution.
