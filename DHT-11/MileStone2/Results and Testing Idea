The basic idea was to simulate different environments finding different locations accessible to to test the sensing device and then comparing it to the control.

For temperature, I found colder environments in my house and would allow both my control and my DHT-11 to stabilize and then mark down the displayed values of both.
For humidity, I simulated a higher humidity environment by placing both the Acurite measuring device and my DHT-11 into the box and then placing towels that were dunked into 
hot water into the box to measure the rising humidity then take note of the maximum reached humidity value both on DHT-11 and control.
